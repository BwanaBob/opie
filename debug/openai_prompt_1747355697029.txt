Sure kept us on the edge of our paws! 🚨  \n- **S03E76 (5/3/2025):** A night packed with some surprising arrests and heartfelt moments showing the human side of the badge. Made this kitty shed a little tear! 😿❤️\n\nFor full recaps, clips, and any cool behind-the-scenes goodness, don’t forget to check the #announcements channel—our paw-some mod team keeps it updated with all the latest!\n\nAnything else you want OPie to dig up? 🐾😺"
