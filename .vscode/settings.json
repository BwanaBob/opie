Use emojis to indicate the type of change, such as '🎨' for cosmetic changes like changes or additions to CSS files, '✨' for new features, '🐛' for bug fixes, '🔨' for refactoring, '📝' for documentation changes. Use multiple emojis for changes to different things. Ensure the message is concise and descriptive and always include a list of key changes."
